 # Retrospective Document Sprint 2
 ## What went well in Sprint 2

- I completed T.3 (Shared State across pages) by working with top-level state that is passed to feature
 pages and updated through user interactions.

- I completed my individual requirement by building the RSVP feature page, including a reusable form component 
that receives state and setter functions as props and updates the page in real time.

- Based on instructor feedback from Sprint 1, I corrected the workflow by changing iterations 
from modules to sprints, which improved sprint tracking and Kanban clarity.

-I ensured that all Kanban issues were linked to Git branches, creating a clear connection
 between sprint items, development work, and pull requests.


  ## What could have gone better in Sprint 2

- Some issues were not initially linked to branches, which caused confusion and required correction after feedback.

- I had to refactor some work once expectations around sprint structure and tracking became clearer.

- Kanban updates were sometimes done late instead of throughout development.


##What I will improve in the next sprint

- For the next sprint, I will create and link a branch from each Kanban issue before starting work, 
and verify the link before opening a pull request.

- I will review sprint requirements and instructor feedback at the start of the sprint to avoid rework.

- I will prototype feature pages or form logic first, then begin sprint work once the approach meets acceptance criteria.
