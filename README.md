## Project General Description
This project is an Event Management website for conferences, weddings, and school events that help users view event details, register to attend, and see event schedules.

### High-Level User Stories
- As a user, I want to view event details (date, time, location, and description), so that I can decide if I want to attend.
- As a user, I want to register for an event, so that I can reserve my spot and receive confirmation.
- As a user, I want to view the event schedule, so that I can plan which sessions or activities to attend.
