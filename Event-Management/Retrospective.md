# Retrospective Document

## What went well in the previous sprint?
During Sprint 1, our team successfully set up the project repository, established a consistent folder structure, and implemented core components, including the EventsCard and Services components. We followed a feature-branch workflow and used pull requests to merge changes into the develop branch, thereby avoiding conflicts. Team communication was effective, and tasks were clearly divided, allowing each member to contribute independently while still aligning with the overall project goals.

## What could have gone better in the previous sprint, or went poorly?
One challenge during Sprint 1 was aligning all components with the original high-level user stories. In particular, the Services component did not initially map clearly to an existing user story, leading to some uncertainty and additional revisions. We also encountered difficulties debugging TypeScript errors and resolving editor warnings, which slowed development and increased fatigue toward the end of the sprint.

### What can be done in the next sprint to improve my process?
In Sprint 2, I would like to address the misalignment issues experienced in Sprint 1. I will ensure that every new component is directly linked to at least one clearly defined user story before implementation begins. This will be tracked by reviewing user stories during sprint planning and confirming alignment before coding starts. This requires only better planning and documentation, not additional tools. This will reduce rework and confusion experienced during Sprint 1. This process will be applied throughout Sprint 2.
In Sprint 2, I would like to standardize React component structure and TypeScript usage across the project. All new components will follow an agreed template and compile without TypeScript errors or warnings. We already have working examples such as the EventsCard component. This will reduce debugging time and improve code readability. This goal will be completed by the end of Sprint 2.
In Sprint 2, I would like to improve team coordination by confirming task ownership and branch usage before development begins. Each task will have a clearly assigned team member and a corresponding feature branch. This builds on the workflow already used in Sprint 1. This will reduce confusion around branches and pull requests. This will be implemented starting with the next sprint planning meeting.
